DENNIS - Dynamic ENdpoint Network Interface Switchover

This project started with a very specific use case in mind

As the name suggests, it monitors two network interfaces. If the primary iface goes down, the secondary iface gets its IP changed and NetworkManager is restarted.

Yes, it is over-engineered and it is a stupid solution to a simple problem of having terrible WiFi adapters.
Yes, I added ENpoint to the acronym so it spells out Dennis.

Also uses Telegram for alerts.
